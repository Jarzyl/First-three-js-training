# First Three.js Training project

This is my first project using three.js. I prepared it while working on a project for my master's thesis.

I shared it for the first time when I published my first portfolio. The page took a long time to load due to the huge size of the model files. It generated 21.3mb of transfer and 46.1mb of resources, and the Finish time was 49.19s.

I'm coming back to this project after a month, having gained some knowledge about performance optimization.

I use gltf-pipeline to convert my .glb models into .gltf and compress them with Draco.

Also compress jpg files with TinyPNG.

Thanks to these actions, the transfer size was reduced to 5.8mb and the amount of resources to 8.4mb, which allowed the page to Finish load under 2s. This is a very good performance improvement. 

I leave this page as a reminder of my beginnings with 3D graphics.
